🎬 Project: Movie Review Management System

🔍 Objective

The project aims to build a RESTful web application where:

Admins can add movies

Users can submit reviews

The system dynamically calculates and updates average movie ratings

Users can search and filter movies by title or genre

This backend simulates a mini version of platforms like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Technology	Role
Java	Core language
Spring Boot	REST API framework
Spring Data JPA	ORM for database access
MySQL / H2 (assumed)	Database to store movies & reviews
Lombok	Reduces boilerplate for entities
Jackson	JSON serialization/deserialization

🧩 Key Functional Modules
1. 🎞️ Movie Module
Entity: Movie.java

Attributes: Title, Genre (Enum), Rating (calculated), List of Reviews

Features:

Admin adds new movies using POST /admin/movie/add

Search movies by title using GET /movie/title

Filter top-rated movies by genre via GET /movie/genre

Logic:

Movies hold a list of reviews.

Average rating is calculated and stored after each review.

MovieResponse DTO is used to return only essential movie data with nested reviews.

2. 📝 Review Module
Entity: Review.java

Attributes: Review text, rating (double), movie ID (foreign key)

Features:

Add a review using POST /review/add

Get review by ID using GET /review/find

Logic:

Upon saving a review, the system:

Fetches associated movie

Calculates new average rating (native SQL query)

Updates the movie's rating

3. 📚 Enums & DTOs
Genre: Enum for predefined genres like ACTION, COMEDY, etc.

MovieRequest, ReviewRequest: Input DTOs to receive request data.

MovieResponse, ReviewResponse: Output DTOs to send structured JSON data back to clients.

💡 System Flow Example
Admin sends a POST request to add a movie.

A user submits a review for that movie.

The backend saves the review and recalculates the average rating using SQL.

When someone searches the movie by title or genre, they see:

Title

Genre

Average Rating

List of reviews

🧠 Best Practices Implemented
✅ DTO Pattern to separate entity logic from controller data

✅ Service Layer for business logic separation

✅ Exception Safe Design using null checks

✅ Enum Validation for secure genre input

✅ Native SQL Query for optimized average rating calculation

🚀 Possible Enhancements
Add authentication (Admin/User login via Spring Security)

Add pagination to genre results

Add comments or nested replies to reviews

Add movie images/posters (media URLs)

Integrate with frontend (React, Angular, etc.)

Add Swagger for API documentation
